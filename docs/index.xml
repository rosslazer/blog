      <description>After nearly a decade of working on observability products, I&amp;rsquo;m taking a much-needed break and working on the first human security company. With all those years under my belt, I still have an axe to grind. This post is my best effort to summarize some of the trends and opportunities I see in this space.

      <description>After 3 spirited months of grinding my co-founder Nick and I have decided to pivot. In September we were accepted into the South Park Commons Founder Fellowship and our journey started. We had a lot of ideas but after stack ranking them according to founder-market fit, technical risk, and market risk, we went with our AI Observability idea. The plan was to sprint on the idea for 3 months and see if we could hit the goals that we set.</description>

      <description>After 4 years at Observe, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that I&amp;rsquo;m starting a company with my longtime friend and abettor Nick DiRienzo! Today marks a unique occasion where an unexpected encounter from nearly ten years ago profoundly altered the course of my life. In 2012 I met Nick DiRienzo at a Startup Weekend hackathon in Rochester NY. Working late into the night fueled by knockoff energy drinks and pizza we became friends and by the next morning left without exchanging numbers.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning GPT3.5-turbo based on 140k slack messages</title>

      <description>I recently started using the Smart Connections plugin for the Obsidian note-taking app. It generates embeddings for all of my notes and allows me to chat with them using GPT. Over the weekend I used it to generate Twitter and LinkedIn posts for a blog piece I was working on. While it produced quality content it had a lot of trouble replicating my writing style. The completions didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like something I would write myself.</description>

      <title>Code Yellow: The Secret Weapon for Tackling Product Disarray</title>

      <description>Code Yellow: The Secret Weapon for Tackling Product Disarray Are you a startup that&amp;rsquo;s been heads down racing to build features and now finds yourself with more bugs than time or people? Or maybe you are a larger company that’s let your product fall into disarray? If this resonates with you, it&amp;rsquo;s time to call for a Code Yellow and establish a War Room.
What is a Code Yellow? The term &amp;ldquo;Code Yellow&amp;rdquo; seems to have originated at Google [1].</description>

      <title>GPT4: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love LLMs</title>
      <link>https://rosslazer.com/posts/gpt4/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://rosslazer.com/posts/gpt4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rosslazer.com/images/gpt4-blog-header.png&#34; alt=&#34;Header&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been internally conflicted about the rapid developments of Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HN Denizen Jason Hansel left a comment on &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35203262&#34;&gt;Tim Bray&amp;rsquo;s The LLM Problem&lt;/a&gt; that is the best summary of how I feel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I agree with the general point that there is, at present, far too much uncertainty to understand the long-term effects of LLMs. It will be somewhere on the scale between &amp;ldquo;semi-useful toy,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;ends white-collar work as we know it,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;accidentally destroys mankind.&amp;rdquo; Beyond that, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much we can say.” - &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35205175&#34;&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35205175&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the rapid developments coming out of OpenAI, I think it’s unlikely that LLMs just end up being useful toys. There’s been a lot of goalposts shifting about what intelligence means. A few years ago it was the Turing test, now that GPT4 has &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/research/gpt-4&#34;&gt;blown away nearly every standardized test&lt;/a&gt;, I think it’s safe to say that white-collar work is at serious risk. As far as accidentally destroying humanity, that’s a toss up, but there isn’t a ton of evidence for that right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of my predictions for what it means for white-collar work and the future of information management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://rosslazer.com/posts/use-it-or-lose-it-p1&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about why you should implement a usage-based pricing model, now let’s get into the meat of how you actually implement one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired much by the success of companies like Snowflake, &lt;a href=&#34;https://observeinc.com/&#34;&gt;Observe Inc.&lt;/a&gt; set out to build a usage based pricing model. I’ve learned a ton from this process and continue to do so each week. This blog series will catalog our journey and things I wish we had known on day 1. It’s broken up into 3 parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first product hire at &lt;a href=&#34;https://observeinc.com/&#34;&gt;Observe Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, I was tasked with bringing in a lot of tooling to solve problems. I’ve put together this list in the hopes of making the journey easier for others. Feel free to submit a PR if there’s more you think I should add.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently building something new at Mirage Security with my longtime friend Nick DiRienzo. In prior lives I was Head of Product at Observe Inc, and a PM at Splunk. This blog was put together to capture my ramblings and lessons learned about startups, product management, and product marketing.
Outside of work you will find me reading and watching anything scifi fiction, brewing beer, and cycling.</description>
