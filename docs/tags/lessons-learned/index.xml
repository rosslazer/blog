      <description>I met with two founders recently, exploring a new idea. As a habit, I always try to make time for founders. Paying forward the way other founders did for me in the early days. These founders were exploring an AI tooling idea, and I was a prospect.
I asked them a simple question:
“Have you ever built a production AI application like ours?”
“No.”
“Ok, why should I trust you to provide a solution to monitor ours?</description>

      <description>After nearly a decade of working on observability products, I&amp;rsquo;m taking a much-needed break and working on the first human security company. With all those years under my belt, I still have an axe to grind. This post is my best effort to summarize some of the trends and opportunities I see in this space.

      <description>After 3 spirited months of grinding my co-founder Nick and I have decided to pivot. In September we were accepted into the South Park Commons Founder Fellowship and our journey started. We had a lot of ideas but after stack ranking them according to founder-market fit, technical risk, and market risk, we went with our AI Observability idea. The plan was to sprint on the idea for 3 months and see if we could hit the goals that we set.</description>

      <description>After 4 years at Observe, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that I&amp;rsquo;m starting a company with my longtime friend and abettor Nick DiRienzo! Today marks a unique occasion where an unexpected encounter from nearly ten years ago profoundly altered the course of my life. In 2012 I met Nick DiRienzo at a Startup Weekend hackathon in Rochester NY. Working late into the night fueled by knockoff energy drinks and pizza we became friends and by the next morning left without exchanging numbers.</description>
