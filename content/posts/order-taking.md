When I started Mirage, I went hunting for "desperate" customers to validate direction. The playbook for enterprise seemed straightforward: cold outreach → design partners → first cohort. It worked. But then I learned a crucial lesson that turned my assumptions upside down: **desperation != urgency**.

In enterprises, the person feeling the pain rarely controls the budget. Executive buyers get looped in, procurement cycles kick off, and committees form. If a problem isn't truly urgent, these deals turn into molasses. The litmus test: Are you selling a painkiller or a vitamin? Corporate bureaucracy can move at lightspeed when there's a bleeding wound and an immediate fix. Everything else gets stuck in the machine.

## Being a Strong Founder Makes This Worse

It's never been easier for a strong founder to fall into the fake product-market fit trap. If you're a strong founder, you will undoubtedly be able to sell something. This problem compounds when you believe you're fishing in the right pond, raise a bunch of money, and double down on an idea that will have a middling outcome. You didn't sign up to build a small business. You signed up for venture scale or bust.

## Order Taking

The best signal of an outsized outcome is when sales feels like **order taking**. It's hard to describe until you've felt it, but customers start lining up. You won't be selling anymore; your customers will be buying.

**My take:** go slow to go fast. Don't spin up marketing and a sales team until you feel that pull. If you can't close $1M without marketing spend and 10 AEs, you might be building something middling. Don't get distracted by desperation if you can't find urgency.
