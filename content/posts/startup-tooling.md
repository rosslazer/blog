As the first product hire at [Observe Inc.](https://observeinc.com/), I was tasked with bringing in a lot of tooling to solve problems. Iâ€™ve put together this list in the hopes of making the journey easier for others. Feel free to submit a PR if thereâ€™s more you think I should add.

### Wiki
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - Fun fact: For a short time we used notion databases as our project management tool but outgrew it.
### Observability & Monitoring
* [Observe](observeinc.com) - Shameless plug ðŸ˜œ
* [Uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) - No frills synthetic monitoring. Pings all of the things.
### Communication
* [Slack](https://slack.com)
* [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)
* [GSuite](https://gsuite.google.com/)
### Video Conferencing Equipment
* [Neat.no](https://neat.no/) - Most of the hardware suppliers require you to go through a local reseller and buy separate components. This company is a one click stop for getting integrated zoom equipment.
### Project Management
* [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) - We probably complain about it on a daily basis but it feels too risky to try one of the upstarts at this time.
### SOC2 Compliance
* [Vanta](https://vanta.com/) - SOC2 in a box. This company saved my ass as someone who had never run lead this process before.
* [Checkr](https://checkr.com/) - We are required to do background checks as part of our SOC2 controls.
* [KnowBe4](https://www.knowbe4.com/) - Security awareness training works.
### Billing & Usage
* [Ordway Labs](https://www.ordwaylabs.com/) - Observe has a usage based pricing model so we could not use the traditional billing system vendors. Ordway caters to B2B companies and has a tight integration with Salesforce.
* [Bill.com](http://bill.com/) - Before we had any systems in place we would manually bill using this company.
### Business Intelligence
* [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) - This is an open source BI tool that I used to quickly iterate on usage dashboards for sales. It got the job done well since I was game to write a lot of SQL.
* [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) - We dump all of the datas here.
### Customer Success
* [Intercom](https://intercom.io/) - We use a custom embed so that there is no floating bar in our app.
* [Slack](https://slack.com/) - All of our customers get invited to a separate user group slack workspace.
### SalesOps
* [Gong](https://www.gong.io/) - Out of all of the tools this is the one I didn't know I needed. It records and transcribes all of the sales calls. It's been an invaluable tool for tuning our messaging and hearing from customers.
* [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/)
* [Salesloft](https://salesloft.com/)
### Marketing
* [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/) - I can't believe this is still best in class in 2022 but here we are.
* [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) - I've still barely scratched the service with what this can do.
* [Reprise](https://www.getreprise.com/) - This lets you build interactive click through demos.
[Closefactor](https://closefactor.com/) - Enriches our account lists with special factors we can use for targeting and prioritization.
[Zoominfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/)
* [Hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/)
### Webinars
* [Livestorm](https://livestorm.co/) - I really wanted a webinar platform that worked in a browser and had good looking forms. This checks all of the boxes at a very reasonable price point.
* [Frame.io](https://www.frame.io/) - Video review software we use to give feedback to video editors.
* [Riverside.fm](https://riverside.fm/) - High quality video interview recording. If you're using zoom to record a customer interview you're sacrificing a lot of quality.
### Blogging
* [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/)
* [Wordpress] (https://wordpress.com/)
