I'm currently building something new at [ROSNIK AI](https://www.rosnik.ai/) with my longtime friend [Nick DiRienzo](https://nickdirienzo.com/). In prior lives I was Head of Product at [Observe Inc](https://observeinc.com/), and a PM at Splunk. This blog was put together to capture my ramblings and lessons learned about startups, product management, and product marketing.

Outside of work you will find me reading and watching anything scifi fiction, brewing beer, and cycling.
